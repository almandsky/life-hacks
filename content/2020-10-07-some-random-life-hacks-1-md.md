Welcome to the first volume of my random life hacks! In each article, I put 7 life hacks that will help you in everyday life. So, here is the first volume!

1. In Taiwan, if you ask them to give you some kind of juice or pudding, tell them to store your desired food in a bag. That way, you will get more food.
2. SLEEP IS BETTER THAN WORK! It actually is.
3. Try to have a balanced diet. That's better than just only eating meat or just only eating vegetables.
4. Can't play the chrome dino game by going offline? Go to chromedino.com to play online for free.
5. Make Google a pirate by going to Search Settings, then go to Languages, then find "Pirate." Now, "Images" will be "Engravin's".
6. The healthiest drink of all is water.
7. Don't take stupid drugs! During an experiment, someone discovered that of tons of people that took drugs, 99.96 percent experienced no benefit.

So here is the first volume of random life hacks! Look forward to the next one!
